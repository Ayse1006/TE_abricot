# TE_abricot
Distribution of TEs and their relationship to genes (and gene expression) in Apricot

Calculate the relationship between TEs and genes in basing on the TE annotation gff (REPET) and genome annotation gff (Braker214):

1)	TEs overlap with Genes
2)	Distance between TE with upstream Gene and downstream Gene
